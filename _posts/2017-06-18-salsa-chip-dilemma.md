title:  "The Salsa-Chip Dilemma"

I have stumbled across a troubling phenomenon today. I have found that while eating salsa and tortilla chips, my behavior inevitably falls into a specific pattern. A pattern that is not so great for my health.

So I pour myself some salsa and chips and begin to enjoy. Before too long I run out of salsa. I say to myself, "Better get some more chips to go with the rest of this salsa".

So I pour some more chips and the party in my mouth continues.

A few minutes later, I finally run out of chips. "Uh oh," I say. "Better get some more salsa to go with the rest of these chips."

So I get some more salsa.

Then I run out of salsa again...

See a pattern? I don't know what to do about this yet, but the first step to fixing a problem is to recognize it. Therefore, I will henceforth refer to this conundrum as the Salsa-Chip Dilemma.

Interestingly, I have realized this pattern also takes place at a higher level: at the grocery store. Just today I bought a jar of salsa to go with the unfinished bag of tortilla chips that I knew I had at home. What will I do when I finish the chips before the salsa? I'll buy more chips to go with the rest of the salsa I bought today.
